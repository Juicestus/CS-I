# CS-314-Assignments

I decided to do some of the assignments from [Mike Scott's CS 314 Course at UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/index.htm)

I started doing [assignments](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/index.htm) the weekend around October 10th, and the next assignment is [A5 - Linked List](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/A5_LinkedLists.html).
